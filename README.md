## Updating Kirby

We have included the [Kirby core](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby) and [Kirby panel](https://github.com/getkirby/panel) as Git submodules so we can easily update everything straight from the source. Documentation for updating Kirby submodules can be found [here](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/working-with-git#updating-kirby).
